# Republish a Course

Let's make some small changes to the site to demonstrate how to republish a course.

Open your `tutors-starter` folder, then navigate to `topic-1`.

Notice the topic title is denoted by a `#` followed by a space. This is Markdown syntax, and it is the title text for the `Simple Units` card. Change this to whatever you wish - either the title or the description.

If you make a change, then you will need to

-  `compile` the course (regenerate it). The `compile` process  produces a new version of the  `json` folder located within the `tutors-starter` folder. 
- Drag and drop the newly generated folder `json` folder to the Netlify drop area for your published site as in the last step.  

Here is how to do this:

First, open a Command Prompt (or Terminal on Mac). Side by side open the folder where you course is located:

In the Command Prompt, type:

~~~
cd 
~~~

... make sure to leave a space at the end:

Then Drag & Drop the `tutors-starter` folder from the finder window onto the command prompt:

This will inert the full path of the folder (see above). Press `Return or Enter` now, and then type `dir`

You Command prompt window should look as above - you have changed into the `tutors-course` folder, and verified you are there by entering the `dir` command.

To Compile the course, enter the following, then press return:

~~~
npx tutors-json
~~~

In a few minutes you should see the above - a list of the course contents. The `json` directory will have been updated to the latest version.

The final step is to drag and drop this generated folder onto the Netlify project we set up in the last step.  First, revisit the project on Netlify:

Navigate into the project:

Select `Deploys`:

You should see the Drag & Drop zone above. Proceed to drag and drop the `json` folder again. If all goes well you should see a new deploy listed:

Now revisit the published site to see if your updates have in fact been implemented.
