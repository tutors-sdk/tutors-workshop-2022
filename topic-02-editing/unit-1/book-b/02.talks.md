They represent a PDF version of slide decks but can be any PDF document. Each talk will be rendered initially as a card:

The Title and summary will be drawn from the `.md` file in the talk folder, and the image from a PNG or JPEG file, and the PDF must also be in the folder. You can use any name for these files - but all three file names must be identical. The `.md` file is a simple title and summary:

# Lecture 1

A summary of the talk, no more than two sentences.

Make some cosmetic changes to some of the talks. Compile and republish the course to see the effects. A summary of how to compile/publish is in the previous step of this lab.
