### Labs

The `book-a` folder represents a lab, where you can use Markdown to outline steps for a class to follow. A Markdown guide is provided in a later lab in this series. Each lab is a series of `steps`:

![](/Users/edeleastar/repo/tutors/tutors-docs/topic-01/unit-1/book-b/img/07x.png)

The steps are each represented by separate `.md` files - where each file contains the Markdown format of the step.

These files follow a specific file name convention outlined in a later lab.

`book-*` can also contains `img` and `archives` folders.

### IMG

The `img` folder is where any images used within the lab must be stored so they can be linked. It is important to note that each `book-*` folder has its own `img` folder and will not find images placed in any lab `img` folder other than its own.

The markdown syntax for inserting an image is:

~~~md
![Image Description](img/name-of-image.png)
~~~

### Archives

The `archives` folder is where any archived files such as `.zip` `.rar` `.tar.gz` must be stored so they can be linked to and downloaded. Like the `img` folder, the `archives` folder is specific to the `book-*` folder it is contained in and will not find archives in another lab's `archives` folder.

The Markdown syntax for inserting an archive link is:

~~~md
- [Arechive Name](archives/archive.zip)
~~~

The tutors-starter course you downloaded has a range of examples of markdown content. Some of this is very specialised (Latex) and can be ignored.
