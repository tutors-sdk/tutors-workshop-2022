# Tutors Elements

Each element in Tutors is represented by a card with a particular icon displayed on the upper right-hand side. This image depicts most topic types and their corresponding icons:

The following is the sample Tutors course template used in this lab step which contains a sample of each topic type. This can be used to incorporate additional topic types into your course, or just to further help understand topic structure.

Five topic types can be utilised, as well as the option of displaying a `.pdf` file in either a `topic` or `unit`:

- **Lecture**: These are represented in the file structure as `talk-*` and can contain a `.pdf` file, viewable as a slide deck, as well as a YouTube link or embedded video.

- **Lab**: Represented in the file structure as `book-*` and contains a series of `.md` Markdown files, each containing a complete Lab step.

- **Archives**: Represented in the file structure as `archives` and links to a `.zip`, `.rar`, `.tar.gz` file to be downloaded. Archives can also be placed within a Labs `archives` folder.

- **GitHub Repository**: Represented in the file structure as `github-*-template-*` and contains a file with a link to the specified GitHub repo. This file can be opened and edited by any text editor, such as Notepad.

- **Web Link**: Represented in the file structure as `web-1` and contains a file with a link to the specified website.

- **Panel Talk**: Represented in the file structure as `paneltalk` and contains a `.pdf` file which is displayed in the topic or unit in which the `paneltalk` folder is located.

Each of these folders also contains a `.md` Markdown file. These will be discussed in the next lab step.

The following is an example topic that contains two units, each unit contains:

  - A Unit Heading
  - 2 Lecture topics
  - 2 Lab topics
  - 1 Archive topic
  - 2 GitHub Repo topics
  - 1 Web Link topic

Unit 2, while containing the same topics as Unit 1, also contains a `Panel Talk` which displays a `.pdf` file:
