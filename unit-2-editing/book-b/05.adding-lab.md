# Adding a lab

We are going to add another lab to our course. 

This time we are going to edit the first unit in `topic-03`, the `Units with Videos+` card. In this unit we already have 2 labs. [Note: labs are referred to as `book-*` in the file structure.]

The easiest way to add another lab is to copy and paste it.  Right-click on the chosen lab and click `Copy.`

Right-click on `unit-1` and click `Paste`. This adds in another folder called `book-a-copy`. We can rename this folder to `book-c`.

We would then edit the markdown files within the `book-c` folder and change it to the content we want to be displayed.

Save the file and recompile it by typing `npx tutors-json` into the terminal. 

Drag and drop the newly generated JSON folder to the Netlify drop area for your published site.
