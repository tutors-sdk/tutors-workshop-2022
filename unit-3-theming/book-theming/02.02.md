# Opening a course

The course reader is built as an SPA (single page application) using svelte-spa-router. This uses hash based routing to load a course.

For the below example, we will use this workshop's deployed netlify URL to read from.

First up, let's open the course reader we are running by navigating to the course URL displayed in your terminal window.
